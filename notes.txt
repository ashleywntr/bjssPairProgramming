Task
Buying a house in the UK incurs a tax which varies according to the price of the house and circumstances of the purchaser e.g. a higher rate is paid if you are buying a second home. In Scotland this is called Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT), but you may know it as Stamp Duty (The equivalent tax in England).

We need you to write a piece of code which given the price of a house will calculate the LBBT due to be paid. A key part of any technical project is gaining understanding in unfamiliar business domains, for this reason we do not include how to calculate LBTT as part of this specification. LBTT can be complex to calculate as it varies according to the circumstances of the buyer so for simplicity you may assume:
•	The buyer of the house currently owns a property and lives in it as their main residence
•	The buyer does not conduct any kind of business activity from their house i.e. it is purely for personal use
•	The buyer does not own any other properties
•	At the end of the purchase the buyer will still only own one house i.e. they intent to sell their current home at the same date they buy the new one
Note: Across the UK changes to how this tax is calculated have been made recently, or in the case of Scotland are being changed this week. We are happy for you to use the old or the new calculation but advise you use as the older one as it is simpler to understand and information more readily available. You will not be penalised in any way for whichever version you implement.
